// Configuration the panel owns, kept beside Supervisor's own options.
//
// The add-on's options have outgrown what a Supervisor schema can express. Nested groups do not
// render in the Configuration tab at all (measured: Supervisor parses a documented depth-2 dict,
// registers its translation, and the frontend draws nothing), sub-options cannot carry
// descriptions, and there is no validation beyond types — no "this rule matches none of your
// dashboards", no preview, no conditional fields. Everything behavioural is heading for the
// panel, which has none of those limits and, unlike a YAML file, knows what is connected right
// now.
//
// PER-KEY OWNERSHIP, not a wholesale takeover. This file records only the keys the panel has
// actually been used to change. Everything else falls through to `/data/options.json` exactly as
// before. That matters for two reasons:
//
//   * Nothing is stranded. Ship this before the panel can edit a given option and that option
//     still comes from YAML, still renders in the Configuration tab, still works.
//   * Nothing is silently ignored. The failure mode of a wholesale switch is a user editing the
//     Configuration tab and watching it do nothing, with no indication why. Here, an option is
//     owned here only because someone deliberately changed it here.
//
// A key adopted here is SEEDED from its YAML value, so taking ownership never changes behaviour
// on its own — the first save writes what was already in effect.
//
// BOOTSTRAP KEYS ARE NEVER ADOPTED. How the process binds and finds Home Assistant has to be
// answerable before any of this is readable, and has to stay fixable from the Configuration tab
// when the panel is the thing that is broken.

// scanning for `trim_themes` among `mdns_services` and `cert_monitor_host`. Grouped, the trim
// switches sit together and read as one decision with nine parts.
//

// warning each, which is right for a page you read once while setting up and wrong for a row you
// scan. The long text stays in translations/en.yaml.
