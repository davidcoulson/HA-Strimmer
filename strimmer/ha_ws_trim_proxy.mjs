// ha_ws_trim_proxy.mjs — reverse proxy that serves the REAL Home Assistant frontend
// but trims the entity firehose so a kiosk dashboard loads fast with full fidelity.
//
// It proxies all HTTP straight through to HA (frontend bundles, auth, registries,
// lovelace config, custom-card resources — untouched). All websocket upgrades also pass
// through EXCEPT /api/websocket, which is the only connection it intercepts:
//   * subscribe_entities (no filter)  -> inject entity_ids = the dashboards' allowlist,
//                                         so HA streams only those entities.
//   * get_states result               -> filtered to the allowlist.
// Everything else (auth handshake, registries, config, events) passes through, so the
// real frontend renders your real cards — just without the all-entities firehose.
//
// The allowlist is computed at startup from each dashboard's lovelace/config (walked by
// ./lovelace_extract.mjs), unioned across all configured dashboards, then rebuilt live
// whenever HA fires `lovelace_updated` (a dashboard was edited) — no restart needed.
//
// Runs in two modes (auto-detected):
//   * HA add-on  — reads /data/options.json, uses SUPERVISOR_TOKEN via the supervisor
//                  proxy for the allowlist precompute, proxies to http://homeassistant:8123.
//   * dev/CLI    — reads env vars, uses HA_TOKEN against HA_BASE directly.
//
// Env (dev): HA_TOKEN, HA_BASE (default http://homeassistant.mgmt:8123), PORT (9123),
//   DASH_PATHS (comma/newline list), ALWAYS_FORWARD, NEVER_FORWARD (literals or /regex/),
//   STRIP_ENTITIES (default 1; 0 = passthrough for A/B compare),
//   ALLOW_WS_URL / ALLOW_TOKEN (override the allowlist-precompute connection).

// navigates elsewhere, and every other client opening that dashboard pays for them.

// (see resolveClientRules): a DHCP lease can move, and a name that resolves through your own DNS
// keeps working when it does. Note mDNS/`.local` names generally do NOT resolve from inside the

// another card's name matches it just as well. Measured on a real instance, that kept four
// bundles a dashboard never used — bubble-card and simple-swipe-card both contain the string
// `grid-layout`, utility-cards and swipe-navigation both contain `navbar-card`, because each
// integrates with them. On a px30 wall panel those four cost 1,326 ms of parsing on every load,
// 10% of a 13.3-second cold start, for cards that were never on the page.
//
// A card's provider almost always says so in its FILE NAME: `navbar-card` lives in
// navbar-card.js, `whisker-card` in whisker.js, `grid-layout` in layout-card.js. So when some
// resource's path identifies it as the provider, only those resources satisfy that card type,
// and a bundle that merely name-drops it no longer counts.
//
// The frequency test uses PATH frequency, not body frequency, and the distinction matters: on
// that instance `layout` appears in 24 of 42 bundle bodies — far too common to identify anything
// — while naming exactly one file. Judged by bodies it is noise; judged by paths it is the answer.

// When nothing identifies a provider this returns null and the old body test runs unchanged, so
// the failure mode is the behaviour that shipped before, never a resource dropped on a guess.

//
//   * NO COST ON A NORMAL PAGE LOAD. This is an admin screen, read occasionally, so it is a pull:
//     nothing is added to the dashboard responses that every panel fetches on every boot.
//   * REACHING IT IS THE PROOF. A panel cannot tell from a page alone whether the trimmer served
//     it or whether it is talking straight to Home Assistant. It does not need a header to find
//     out — this path exists only on the proxy, so a 200 here means the proxy is in the path and
//     a 404 means it is not. That is the whole "is it running" question, answered by arriving.
//   * A PANEL SEES ITSELF, NOT THE ESTATE. The reply describes the caller and nothing else. There
//     is deliberately no way to ask about another address: this port is reachable by anything on
//     the network, so every field here has to be something that network may read. That rules out

//     query strings. Measured on a live instance: 2 webhook ids, 37 HLS stream tokens and 4
//     signed camera-proxy paths sitting in the ring. A webhook id is a bearer credential — anyone
//     who knows one can POST to it with no authentication and fire whatever it drives.
//   * /entities.json and /devices.json are a complete inventory of the house, by name.
//   * /config.json carries the override rules, which name Home Assistant users.
//   * /stats.json names every connected client: address, resolved user, User-Agent, internal
//     hostname and mDNS device name.
//
// Query strings were already stripped from the log, which is why the JWT in ?authSig= never
// reached it. Paths were not, and that is the half that mattered.

//
// Counts and byte totals are kept, because that is what a health check and a dashboard card are
// actually for. The per-client list becomes a number: "6 connected" is the useful part, and
